# PHPSmartClasses

This repository consists of a set of PHP classes I have made to work with my personal smarthome projects. Some of them will likely be useless to most people, but for the single souls that have the same interests as me, here you go.

Some of these classes will be incomplete because of my personal use cases and interests.

Every module will have it's own readme file and instructions.
